# Contributing to Dynastia

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Dynastia, the open source tool for creating family histories in D&D. These are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Getting Started

To get started, we need a well written guide here. :smiley: This project is still in the early stages so feel free to help with this guide itself. We also have a [Gitter setup](https://gitter.im/opendnd/dynastia) so you can message one of us directly.
